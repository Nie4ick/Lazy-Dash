# Lazy Dash

**There's no description, I'm very lazy**

## What is this?

Lazy Dash makes your Geometry Dash player... well, lazy. Your cube will randomly experience various "lazy moments" that make playing the game much more challenging (and hilarious).

## Random Events

Your player can randomly trigger one of 9 different lazy behaviors:

### 1. **Faint** 
- All controls are completely blocked
- Duration: 1-2 seconds
- The player just passes out!

### 2. **Walk Backwards** 
- Your player decides to walk in the opposite direction
- Duration: 0.5-1 second
- Good luck with that!

### 3. **Tired** 
- Movement speed reduced to 50%
- Duration: 1.5-3 seconds
- Too tired to go fast

### 4. **Weak Jump** 
- Jump height reduced to 60%
- Duration: 1.5-2.5 seconds
- Low energy jumps only

### 5. **Stutter** 
- Movement alternates between stopped and normal every 10 frames
- Duration: 1.5-2.5 seconds
- Stop and go pattern

### 6. **Deep Sleep** 
- Speed reduced to 30% 
- 50% chance to ignore jump inputs
- Duration: 2-3 seconds
- Player is barely awake

### 7. **Stumble** 
- Random gravity drops every 15 frames
- Duration: 0.7-1.3 seconds
- Watch out for those falls!

### 8. **Heavy Body** 
- Constant downward gravity pull
- Duration: 1.5-2.5 seconds
- Feels like carrying weights

### 9. **Distracted** 
- Every 3rd jump is completely ignored
- Duration: 2-3 seconds
- Player isn't paying attention

## Settings

### Event Frequency
- Controls minimum frames between events
- Range: 60-600 frames (1-10 seconds)
- Default: 180 frames (3 seconds)

### Event Chance
- Base probability of event triggering
- Range: 1-20
- Default: 3
- Higher = more frequent events

### Individual Event Weights
- Each event has its own weight (0-100)
- Set to 0 to disable specific events
- Higher weight = more likely to occur
- Default: 10 for all events

## Tips

- All events reset on death/restart
- Lower event frequency for easier gameplay
- Disable annoying events by setting their weight to 0
- Combine multiple events for maximum chaos
- Practice mode recommended for first attempts!

## Why?

Because playing Geometry Dash normally is too easy. Why not make your player randomly lazy?
